For example, there is no public API\nfor processes to communicate with each other. This is a really important\nability, but it is also something that is extraordinarily easy to get wrong!\n\nI think the trend will be towards an Erlang style of concurrency, where every\nprocess has an “event queue” that anyone can send messages to. I currently\nthink the API will be extended to be more like this:\n\n    type Id exit msg\n\n    spawn : Task exit a -> Task x (Id exit Never)\n\n    kill : Id exit msg -> Task x ()\n\n    send : Id exit msg -> msg -> Task x ()\n\nA process `Id` will have two type variables to make sure all communication is\nvalid. The `exit` type describes the messages that are produced if the process\nfails because of user code. So if processes are linked and trapping errors,\nthey will need to handle this. The `msg` type just describes what kind of\nmessages this process can be sent by strangers.\n\nWe shall see though! This is just a draft that does not cover nearly everything\nit needs to, so the long-term vision for concurrency in Elm will be rolling out\nslowly as I get more data and experience.\n\nI ask that people bullish on compiling to node.js keep this in mind. I think we\ncan do better than the hopelessly bad concurrency model of node.js, and I hope\nthe Elm community will be supportive of being more ambitious, even if it takes\nlonger.

It is often best to create a custom type that explicitly represents\nthe exact ways your computation may fail. This way it is easy to handle in your\ncode.\n",

Perhaps unexpectedly, this managed effects idea is the heart of why\nElm is so nice for testing, reuse, reproducibility, etc.\n\nThere are two kinds of managed effects you will use in your programs: commands\nand subscriptions.\n\n@docs Cmd, map, batch, none, (!)\n\n",
